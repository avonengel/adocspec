The adocspec project aims at making writing requirements in AsciiDoc format
possible by using the {oft} tracing toolchain, and extending the syntax they defined for Markdown to AsciiDoc.

== Project Status: Experimental

The project is currently in an exploratory status, where different implementation options are being evaluated. While
requirements may already be specified, not all of the elements used by {oft} are supported, yet.
See <<src/docs/asciidoc/spec#,the specification>> for an example of what is supported.

All supported elements are tested, so you might take a look at
link:src/test/java/com/github/avonengel/adocspec/SpecificationConverterTest.java[SpecificationConverterTest].
