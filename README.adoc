The adocspec project aims at making writing requirements in AsciiDoc format
possible by using the {oft} tracing toolchain, and extending the syntax they defined for Markdown to AsciiDoc.

== Project Status: Alpha

The project is currently in alpha status:

* Requirements may already be specified, but not all of the elements used by {oft} are supported, yet.
* Only paragraph text with standard formatting is supported in requirements' text fields.

See <<src/docs/asciidoc/spec#,the specification>> for an example of what is supported.

All supported elements are tested, so you might take a look at the
link:src/test/java/com/github/avonengel/adocspec/[tests].
